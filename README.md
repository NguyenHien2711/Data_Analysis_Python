# Data_Analysis_Python
Welcome to my repository !<p>
I’m learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by March of 2023<p>
This repository have been created since October, 2022 with intention to practise and showcase my skillsets related to Data Analysis which combines Data analysis exercises and small projects practiced with real dataset by me while learning Python on various platforms and courses.<p>
**The tools and knowledge to complete these tasks:** <br>
  - Knowledge of Statistical Test, Linear Regression 
  - Statistical programming: Python
  - Pandas
  - Numpy 
  - Matplotlib,Seaborn
  - Sklearn, Scipy
  - Program: Jupyter Notebook<p>
**List of files and folders:**
  - [Exploratory Data Analysis with Python ](https://github.com/NguyenHien2711/Data_Analysis_Python/tree/main/Pandas_codegym): This folder make use of 5 real datasets to work on Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn to manupulate, analyse, visulize and conduct pre-processing steps data.
